Description:
    Generates BPMN classes for a BPMN XML in the current Rails app. They will be under app/bpmn. It will first validate the
    bpmn xml to make sure the class names are all populated as expected.

Example:
    rails generate camunda:bpmn_classes bpmn_file

    This will create:
        app/bpmn/#{process_key}/class1
        app/bpmn/#{process_key}/class2
