# Camunda Workflow

## An opinionated interface to Camunda for Ruby/Rails apps

We use [Her](https://github.com/remiprev/her) to communicate with the [Camunda REST API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/rest/). We use the process definition key as the topic name. Tasks are pulled and fetched and locked and then run. We expect classes (ActiveJob) to implement each external task.
    
We will have scripts to run unit tests on the BPMN definitions. This expects Java and Maven.

We also have rspec helpers which will validate your application to make sure it has a class for every External task in a given BPMN file.

## Integration with your worker classes

We have a module `ExternalTaskJob` which you need to include in your classes. We want your classes to inherit from `ActiveJob::Base` or use `Sidekiq::Worker` or not use either.

But right now we are using `perform_later` on worker classes. If we want to make this more flexible we need to make the method used to queue jobs configurable. `perform_later` for ActiveJob, `perform_async` for Sidekiq or `perform` if no background task system is used.

## Generators

### `rails generate camunda:install`
Creates `app/jobs/camunda_job.rb`. A class which inherits from ApplicationJob and includes `ExternalTaskJob`. It can be changed to include
 Sidekiq::Worker instead.  

All of the BPMN worker classes will inherit from this class

### `rails generate camunda:bpmn_classes`
Parses the BPMN file and creates task classes according to the ID of the process file and the ID of 
each task. It checks each task and only creates it if the topic name is the same as the process ID. This 
allows one to have some tasks be handled outside the Rails app. It confirms that the ID's are valid Ruby constant names. 

### `rails generate camunda:unit_tests`
Generates a skeleton Java app which contains the minimal files to run unit tests on a BPMN file.
